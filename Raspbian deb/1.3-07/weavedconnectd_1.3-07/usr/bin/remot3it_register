# remot3.it recommends running this script (with real username/password) from /tmp folder.
# e.g. use wget to copy master script to /tmp from a local web server, then run it.
# on next boot, /tmp folder is wiped
#
# As supplied for demo, script will prompt you for your username and password.

#==================================================================================
# If REGISTERSERVICE is set to 1, then account credentials need to be supplied, either above,
# or if those are left at default values, then the script asks for username and password.
# If REGISTERSERVICE is 0, then the enablement files, binaries, installation and startup scripts
# are installed, but the services are not registered.  In this state they are "ready to register"
# by the end user.

# if REGISTERSERVICE is 1, then it means that we need the account credentials to register the
# services at the time of running this script.
# if REGISTERSERVICE is 0, then all we do is to install the daemon, scripts and initialized enablement files
# in anticipation of either bulk registration at remot3.it.

#==================================================================================
# If STARTDAEMONSONREBOOT is set to "1", then following the execution of the weavedinstaller_OEM script,
# the next time the device is rebooted, the daemons will be started.
# If it is preferred that the daemons not autostart on the next reboot, set STARTDAEMONSONREBOOT to "0".
